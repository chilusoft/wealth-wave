# Privacy Policy for Wealth Wave

**Last Updated: November 21, 2025**

## Our Privacy Commitment

**Wealth Wave is designed with your privacy as the absolute top priority.**

### The Short Version

**We collect ZERO data. Period.**

- ❌ No personal information
- ❌ No financial data
- ❌ No SMS content
- ❌ No analytics
- ❌ No tracking
- ❌ No cloud storage
- ❌ No internet connection required
- ❌ No data ever leaves your device

## Detailed Privacy Statement

### 1. Data Collection

**Wealth Wave does NOT collect any data whatsoever.**

We do not:
- Collect your name, email, phone number, or any identifying information
- Store your SMS messages on any server
- Track your location
- Record your transaction history remotely
- Use analytics tools (Google Analytics, Firebase, etc.)
- Employ any tracking mechanisms
- Connect to any cloud services
- Send any data to any third party
- Use cookies or similar tracking technologies

### 2. How Your Data is Processed

**Everything happens on YOUR device:**

1. **SMS Reading**: The app reads SMS from mobile money providers (MoMo, AirtelMoney, StanChart) using Android's SMS permission
2. **Local Processing**: Transaction information is extracted and processed entirely on your device
3. **Local Storage**: All data is stored in a local SQLite database on your device only
4. **Zero Transmission**: No data is ever transmitted to any server, cloud service, or third party

### 3. Internet Connection

**Wealth Wave does NOT require an internet connection to function.**

- ✅ The app works 100% offline
- ✅ No data is sent over the internet
- ✅ You can block the app with a mobile firewall and it will still work perfectly
- ✅ You can use the app in airplane mode
- ✅ No background data transmission occurs

**Test it yourself:** Block Wealth Wave's internet access using any mobile firewall app (NetGuard, AFWall+, etc.) and verify that all features continue to work normally.

### 4. Permissions Used

Wealth Wave requires only two permissions:

| Permission | Purpose | What We Do | What We DON'T Do |
|------------|---------|------------|------------------|
| **READ_SMS** | To read mobile money transaction SMS | Read only SMS from MoMo, AirtelMoney, and StanChart to detect transactions | We do NOT read personal messages, store SMS content, or access messages from other sources |
| **WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE** | To store transaction database locally | Save your transaction history on your device | We do NOT upload data anywhere or share it with anyone |

### 5. Third-Party Services

**Wealth Wave uses ZERO third-party services.**

We do not integrate with:
- Analytics platforms (Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics, Mixpanel, etc.)
- Crash reporting services (Crashlytics, Sentry, etc.)
- Advertising networks
- Social media platforms
- Cloud storage providers
- Any other third-party services

### 6. Data Sharing

**We do NOT share any data because we don't collect any data.**

Your transaction information:
- ✅ Stays on your device
- ✅ Is never uploaded to any server
- ✅ Is never shared with anyone
- ✅ Is never sold to any third party
- ✅ Is never used for any purpose other than displaying it to you

### 7. Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device:

- Your device's security features (screen lock, encryption) protect your data
- We recommend using a secure lock screen
- If you uninstall the app, all data is deleted
- No data breach is possible because there's no central server

### 8. Children's Privacy

Wealth Wave does not collect any information from anyone, including children. Since we collect no data, there are no age restrictions from a privacy perspective.

### 9. Open Source Transparency

**Wealth Wave is fully open source.**

You can:
- ✅ Review the entire source code on GitHub
- ✅ Verify that no data collection occurs
- ✅ Audit all network requests (there are none)
- ✅ Build the app yourself from source
- ✅ Confirm our privacy claims independently

**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/chilusoft/wealth-wave

### 10. Your Rights

Since we don't collect any data:

- **Right to Access**: All your data is already on your device
- **Right to Delete**: Uninstall the app to delete all data
- **Right to Export**: Your data never leaves your device
- **Right to Opt-Out**: Not applicable - there's nothing to opt out of

### 11. Changes to Privacy Policy

If we ever change how the app handles data (which would be a major change to the app's core philosophy), we will:
- Update this privacy policy
- Notify users through the GitHub repository
- Require explicit consent before any data collection

**Current Promise:** We will NEVER collect user data. This is a core principle of Wealth Wave.

### 12. Contact Information

If you have questions about this privacy policy:
- Open an issue on our [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/chilusoft/wealth-wave/issues)
- Review the source code to verify our claims

### 13. Verification

**Don't just trust us - verify!**

1. **Use a network monitor** (like PCAPdroid, NetGuard) to confirm the app makes no network requests
2. **Block internet access** using a firewall and confirm the app works perfectly
3. **Review the source code** on GitHub to see that there's no data collection code
4. **Build from source** yourself to ensure you're running exactly the code you see on GitHub
